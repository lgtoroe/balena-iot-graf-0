This repository aims to be the first of many as a solution to the implementation of rapid projects in which we can take data from sensors and export it quickly to the web, for this we have chosen Grafana as a platform that has two large data sources such as Prometheus and InfluxDB With this we intend to expose the data sent from python in the case of Raspeeby-PI's GPIO and through node_exporter for system data.
